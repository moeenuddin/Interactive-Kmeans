# Interactive-Kmeans
Build a Visual Display for Kmeans Clustering.

# Experiment


This is a partial implementation of Kmeans. The Evaluation part is yet in to-do.

The idea is to perform K clustering on the basis of distance measure. The data selection is currently
available as Random array selection and Iris Data.

Clustering criteria is to be set in the configure.php or you can set is manaully.

Outliers are all other points which are not satisfying the distance criteria set initially.

Right now, outliers are not gettting recorded or their proximities, i.e to which cluster they are closer.

Convergence criteria is set as a hard line/iterative.
